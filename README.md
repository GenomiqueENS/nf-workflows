# nf-workflows
This bioinformatic pipeline is used for transcript annotation of long-read sequencing data using consensus annotated transcriptome from Isoquant and RNA-Bloom tools.
This workflow is written in nextflow and developped by the GenomiqueENS core facility of the Institute of Biology of the Ecole Normale Superieure (IBENS).
